1. If we want our HTML report to be more user-friendly to read: We want code folding to be enabled and hidden by default (add this option in your YAML header)
*I have added code folding*


2. We want short descriptions
*I have added short descriptions*

3. You mixed up sections (3) and (4)
*I have switched the sections*

4. For defining your DEGs, you used `padj < 0.05` and `long2Foldchange > 2`, but in your volcano plot you used `FCcutoff = 3` and `pCutoff = 1e-100`. It probably makes more sense to have these match up. You may want to increase the height of your volcano plot too.
*I have set both the DEG table and volcano plot to `padj < 0.05` and `long2Foldchange > 2`. I have also increased the height of the volcano plot.*

5. Your PCA plot is scrunched vertically since PC2 captures very little variance. See this link on one way to fix: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/128155/
*I have adjusted the height of the PCA plot.*

6. For your DEG heatmap: There should be 10 DEGs each for over- and under-expressed. Instead you have 6 and 14.
*I was able to include 10 over- and under-expressed DEGs in my heatmap with the code below.*

```
cluster_rows=F, 
cluster_cols=F,
```

7. The `run` legend is redundant as we already see the run IDs in the x-axis.
*I tried to remove the run ID, but was unable to remove the coloured boxes. I instead, have removed the run information on the bottom of the graph so that it is only shown in the legend. I hope that is an acceptable alternative*

8. For part 6, you're missing under-express pathways. Also add relevant metrics to your pathway table (eg. some form of enrichment score, p-value etc.)

*The over expressed pathway displayed under "The Top Over-Expressed KEGG Pathway: NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT" is titled RNA transport in the *
